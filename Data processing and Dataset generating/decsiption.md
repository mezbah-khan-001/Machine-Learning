âš¡ **Ryo Dataset Generator** âš¡

The Ryo Dataset Generator isnâ€™t just another script â€” itâ€™s a **data factory on demand**. ðŸš€ With this tool, you can instantly create **synthetic datasets** in multiple formats like **CSV, XLSX, JSON, JSONL, TXT**, and more, tailored exactly to your projectâ€™s needs.

âœ¨ **What it can do:**

* Accepts user-defined **columns, names, and data types** (numeric, categorical, labels, text, dates, etc.).
* Generates **realistic sample data** instantly, whether you need 100 rows or 10 million.
* Exports to **any format** you choose for maximum flexibility.
* Helps **train, test, and validate ML models** without waiting for real-world datasets.
* Creates **domain-specific synthetic data** for NLP, CV, finance, healthcare, or just pure experimentation.

ðŸ›  **How it works:**

1. You tell the script what dataset you need (columns, data types, size, format).
2. Ryoâ€™s script **builds the schema** and fills it with synthetic but structured data.
3. With one command, youâ€™ve got a clean, ready-to-use dataset.

ðŸ’¡ **Why itâ€™s powerful:**

* No more hunting for messy open datasets.
* **Full control** over your dataâ€™s shape and size.
* Perfect for **ML training, algorithm testing, and rapid prototyping**.

This script transforms your **imagination into datasets**. With Ryo Dataset Generator, data isnâ€™t something you search for â€” itâ€™s something you **create**. âš¡ðŸ§
